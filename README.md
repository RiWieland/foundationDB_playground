playing around with foundationDB

# Problem



# Data Model:

The datamodel follows access patterns. 

# Entities:

Image Files:
The path of the image files represents the key of the file

Rectangles:
Rectangles are modeled with index for identification and the positions of the 4 corners of the rectangle.
The index is used as the same rectangle position could be used for different images.
